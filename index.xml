This iOS app creates a 3d model of what the back-facing camera sees in real-time. When finished, you can export the 3d model to either a sharable USDZ file (which is natively supported in iOS) or a high-resolution OBJ file (that can be imported into many different 3d software packages).</description>

The bundled example scene shows how to connect the rope for a physically simulated crane, a rope bridge and set of swings. The rope component is written with performance in mind and many compute intensive tasks are handled by Unity jobs on separate threads accelerated using the Burst compiler.</description>

It is light, compact and has no backlash (that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed). The inner pulley is 20 teeth, the outer ring is 120 teeth and the belt is 150 teeth.
It was a nightmare to compute the dimensions analytically so I finally gave up and made a small python program that solved the problem numerically.</description>

      <description>After getting an email from yet another person who enjoyed the original Seaside Racing back when it was released on the Xbox 360 in 2010, I decided to start working on a PC port last summer. After a few months of part-time work, it is finally done!
Check it out on itch.io here: seasideracing.se
The gameplay should be exactly the same as the original and the graphics a bit better. The Xbox avatars have been replaced by my own set of randomly generated characters that look just mad enough.</description>

      <description>The Sokol libraries by @Andre Weissflog are simple STB-style cross-platform libraries for C and C++ (written in C) that make it easy to create 2d and 3d graphics projects that work on multiple platforms.
As I had an Android phone at the time, I spent some time implementing Android support in the Sokol library that takes care of context creation, sokol_app.h. My changes were merged in January 2019.</description>

      <description>PICO-8 Display Driver I got an idea the other day to write a display driver in PICO-8 using the GPIO pins and here it is. The cart replaces the flip() function with a custom one that writes the PICO-8 frame buffer to a connected display (with a ssd1351 controller) over SPI using the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. Turns out that it actually works :)
I use this display/controller board from Adafruit</description>

      <guid>https://gustavolsson.github.io/blog/laser-scanner-prototype/</guid>
      <description>For the last couple of weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a custom laser scanner design. Basically, a laser scanner is a device that uses 2 mirrors to direct a laser beam to a specific point in space and it can, when moving fast enough, be used to draw geometric patterns onto some planar surface. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m interested in building a laser scanner is that they&amp;rsquo;re a fundamental component of many CNC machines such as high-end 3d printers (based on the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) or Stereolithography (SLA) techniques) or etching machines.</description>

      <description>When I moved to the new site, I decided not to have a blog because I wanted to focus on making things instead writing updates. What I&amp;rsquo;ve realized is that there is a point to summarizing and publishing a log entry of what I work on from time to time. It helps me see the progress that I&amp;rsquo;m making more clearly and it also gives me time to think through the decisions I make along the way.</description>

      <guid>https://gustavolsson.github.io/projects/resin-printer-idea/</guid>
      <description>Top-Down Resin 3d Printer Idea The idea is to use a pocket of air to keep the surface level of the resin constant throughout the build, guaranteeing consistent layer heights. In addition, the higher pressure might ease reflow of resin after dipping?
High print speeds might be possible if the pocket is filled with pure oxygen gas that inhibits resin hardening at the surface. The focus point of the projector should then be slightly below the surface of the resin.</description>

      <description>Physics Engine This is a 3d rigidbody physics engine I wrote in high-school. I later used it to create the original and the remastered version of Seaside Racing.
Collision Detection I implemented the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi distance algorithm to handle collision detection. As it turns out, the Expanding Polytype Algorithm is not needed to find good contact points when objects intersect (because of the shape of the Minkowski Sum/Difference on intersection) and I used a much simpler algorithm that simply shot a ray &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; along the line going through the two objects&#39; centers.</description>

      <description>Early Projects (1999 to 2007) This page is dedicated to my early travels into programming and computer graphics. The code for most of these experiments and small programs are long gone, but I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to find some remnants in the form of screenshots :)
Robo (2003) Robo was my first ever 3d game. I wrote it using Visual Basic 6 and DirectX8 when I was 13 years old, and I was very proud :)</description>
